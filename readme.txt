A stylized Twitter widget.

== Description ==

A stylized Twitter widget. I created this plugin because I wanted a better looking widget on my personal blog. It's not as complex as some other plugins, but it serves its purpose. The widget will adjust itself to the width of the sidebar automatically. It does use some CSS3 for rounded corners and transitioning, but it will look completely fine on other browsers. It also auto updates the Twitter feed for a specified amount of time which can be changed in the settings page.

== Installation ==

To install, throw the folder "tweeter" into your wp-content/plugins folder. Then go to the dashboard and activate the plugin. Tweeter! should now appear in the widgets section. The Tweeter! settings page can be found under settings in the sidebar of the dashboard.
IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU CHANGE THE SETTINGS BEFORE YOU ENABLE THE WIDGET, OTHERWISE YOUR TWEETS WILL NOT BE VISIBLE.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What settings can you change? =

- Twitter username
- Number of tweets to show
- Feed refresh interval (in ms)
- Show replies?

= Surely you didn't create this, whodunit? =

Alright, I admit, I didn't create every part of this plugin. The code is based on Remy Sharp's twitter.js script. He did an excellent job, so if there's any praising that should be done, please thank him.

The post on his site of twitter.js can be found here:

= I'm not going to tell you my password! =

The beauty of the plugin, is you don't have to. This plugin will never ask for your password, It simply displays your tweets!
